#FINAL YEAR COURSE PROJECT UITM 

This project is objective to create a web-system for detecting image crack or uncrack concrete surface by using Deep Learning Method.
After done with research, The model that being used is Binary CNN Model and with Combination data from Kaggle and dataset from researchers. 

During development, the model can be achieve 99.9% accuracy. However, during the testing, it can achieve less thanm 90% . It founds out that the model
cannot detect the non-subject images since the model had been training for crack and uncrack images.

It also suggested that the Binary CNN model should be combine with other model learning so that the detection can be efficiently used.
